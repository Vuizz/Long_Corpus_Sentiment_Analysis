(Adds background on court proceeding in paragraphs 3-4, comment from Microsoft in paragraphs 5-6,
concern from Britain in paragraph 7) WASHINGTON, June 29 (Reuters) - Canada's Department of Justice
has concluded that Microsoft's deal to buy "Call of Duty" maker Activision Blizzard "is likely to"
lead to less competition in some aspects of gaming, according to a court filing on Thursday. In a
letter dated Wednesday to Microsoft's U.S. lawyers, the department said it had communicated to
Microsoft's and Activision's lawyers in Canada that the deal would likely lead to less competition
in "gaming consoles and multigame subscription services (as well as cloud gaming)." On Thursday, the
letter was put on the docket of a U.S. federal court proceeding in which the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission is asking a judge to temporarily stop the proposed transaction so that an FTC judge will
have time to assesses it. Closing arguments in the proceeding are set for later on Thursday.
Microsoft has pressed for a decision in the court fight before the July 18 termination date for the
deal. A ruling could come as early as next week. In a statement, Microsoft said it was working with
antitrust enforcers to address concerns. "We received notice from the Canada Competition Bureau that
it would continue to monitor our acquisition of Activision Blizzard after the formal waiting period
preventing the deal to close expired," a Microsoft spokesperson said. Microsoft's bid to acquire the
"Call of Duty" videogame maker also faces opposition from British competition authorities.
Microsoft's appeal to Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal is scheduled for July 28. (Reporting by
